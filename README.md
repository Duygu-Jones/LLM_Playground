ü§ñ LLM Playground: <br>
  üå± Exploring Language Models & Chatbots
</h1>

Welcome to the LLM Playground repository! üéâ <br>

- This repository provides a hands-on collection of practical LLM applications, including chatbots, AI agents, SQL and RAG implementations. 
- You'll find examples of model fine-tuning, vector databases, and various LLM integrations using tools like LangChain, CrewAI, and OpenAI more. 
- The projects range from basic chatbots to advanced applications using AWS, NVIDIA, and custom agents for specific tasks.

- **demo.png**: Application screenshot/demo image
- **requirements.txt**: Project-specific dependencies



## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
To explore these projects locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Duygu-Jones/LLM_Playground.git
cd LLM_Playground
```


## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your API keys:
     ```plaintext
     GROQ_API_KEY= "your_groq_api_key"
     OPENAI_API_KEY= "your_openai_api_key"
     ```
     
2. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Global dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Running Applications**
   - Each project can be run independently:
     ```bash
     cd [project_folder]
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
   - Open browser at http://localhost:...
