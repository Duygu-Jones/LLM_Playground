The Evolution of Computer Technology

The journey of computer technology from the 1940s to today represents one of humanity's 
most remarkable achievements. Starting with ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic
 computer that filled an entire room, computers have undergone dramatic miniaturization and 
 performance improvements. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s replaced bulky vacuum tubes, 
 leading to smaller, more reliable machines. The 1970s saw the emergence of personal computers, 
 with companies like Apple and IBM making computing accessible to ordinary people. 
 The 1990s brought the Internet revolution, connecting computers worldwide and transforming 
 how we communicate and access information. Today's smartphones pack more computing power 
 than the machines that guided the Apollo missions to the moon. This rapid evolution continues 
 with quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing pushing the boundaries of 
 what's possible. Modern computers have become an integral part of daily life, powering everything 
 from medical research to space exploration, while becoming increasingly energy-efficient and powerful.
