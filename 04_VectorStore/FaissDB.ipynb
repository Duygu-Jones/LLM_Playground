The introduction of transistors in the 1950s replaced bulky vacuum tubes, \\n leading to smaller, more reliable machines. The 1970s saw the emergence of personal computers, \\n with companies like Apple and IBM making computing accessible to ordinary people. \\n The 1990s brought the Internet revolution, connecting computers worldwide and transforming \\n how we communicate and access information. Today's smartphones pack more computing power \\n than the machines that guided the Apollo missions to the moon. This rapid evolution continues \\n with quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing pushing the boundaries of \\n what's possible.
